This is a WIP implementation for the ["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

This is a toy Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET` over the [REdis Serialization Protocol (RESP)](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/).
